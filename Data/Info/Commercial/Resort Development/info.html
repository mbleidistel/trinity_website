<h2>"Ski Resort - Day Lodge"</h2>

<br>
	Here is a Ski Resort Day Lodge that we have converted to the trinity IPP System. As you can see in the renderings there are virtualy no limits to the size or scope of a Trinity project. We can take any existing plan and redesign it with all the features and benefits one would expect utilizing our construction methods.

	This mountaintop building will feature 12" post and beam timbers and exceptional energy efficient R-40 walls with R-60 roofs. The shell including walls, timbers, roof structure and roof panels can be completed in weeks â€¦ not months, typical of this type of construction.
