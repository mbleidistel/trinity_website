<h2>The "Kitwanga" Squamish B.C.</h2>
<br>
<br>
	This is the first home built in the Lower Mainland, conveniently located near Quest University in Squamish. In an area of fine homes, it lends itself to natural surroundings with stunning mountain and ocean views. The house features an two story open living area with exposed beams throughout.
