<h2>The "Drouillard" Residence</h2>
<br>
<br>
	This is the first home built by Trinity Post & Panel using our Patented IPP System of construction. The House was assembled in eight days, of which, one of the eight days it was snowing so badly we had to stop work. The following week the shingles were applied to the roof and the house was dry. This house is actually an addition to a 300 sq.ft.cabin and the shell was built on three levels, starting with a concrete slab and two crawlspaces of varying height.

	Our customers enjoy their privacy so the view down the driveway is that of a very modest home, it is only upon entering that you see the house is much larger than it seems. The house opens up to an expansive living area and kitchen with views out the Valley through the many windows
