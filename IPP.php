		<h3 id="insulated">Insulated Panels</h3><br>
		<p style=" text-align: justify;">There are many benifits to our patented SIP(Structural Insulated Panels). The polyurethane foam helps to avoid the growth of mold and mildew, as well as discourage the nesting of vermin. This product contains no formaldehydes, is enviromentally friendly, reduces the fuel consumption of and emission costs related to normal heating methods. Materials are prefabed to exact measurements, ensuring that there is a reduction in construction waste related to construction. Panels also act as a natural noise filter, reducing some of the enviromental ambiance problems many people are plagued with. The intnerior foam is highly fire resistant, and will not burn in temperatures under 2000 degrees. All conduits are included in the construction of the panels themselves, reducing the waste on construction site for running pipes, wires and lines.</p>
		<h3 id="assembally">Assembally</h3><br>
		<p style=" text-align: justify;">Our unique design allows for nearly unlimited amount of configurations, and our state of the art production method means that the structural pieces themselves can be modified and ready to ship in several days, in comparrison to several weeks with regular log homes. The log structure itself acts as an exoskelleton, taking and distributing the weight of the building. This leads to the shell being produced and ready on a number of days in comparison to the several month production timeline of the average log home. The logs themselves are treated and only suffer minimal shrinkage from the circumference, and the materials used allow for a near unlimited amount of interior and exterior finishes. Since everything is built tight fitting and there is reduced issues with shrinkage, this reduces the required specialization on the behalf of the contractor.</p>
		<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3><br>
		<p style=" text-align: justify;">There are many examples of our structures avalible today. Here is a short selection of our showhomes.</p>

		<p style=" text-align: justify;">This is the first home built by Trinity Post & Panel using our Patented IPP System of construction. The House was assembled in eight days, of which, one of the eight days it was snowing so badly we had to stop work. The following week the shingles were applied to the roof and the house was dry. This house is actually an addition to a 300 sq.ft.cabin and the shell was built on three levels, starting with a concrete slab and two crawlspaces of varying height. <br><br>Our customers enjoy their privacy so the view down the driveway is that of a very modest home, it is only upon entering that you see the house is much larger than it seems. The house opens up to an expansive living area and kitchen with views out the Valley through the many windows</p>

			<div id="Kitwanga" class="cycle-slideshow" data-cycle-fx="fade" data-cycle-speed="2500">
			</div>
		</div>
		<p style=" text-align: justify;">This is the first home built in the Lower Mainland, conveniently located near Quest University in Squamish. In an area of fine homes, it lends itself to natural surroundings with stunning mountain and ocean views. The house features an two story open living area with exposed beams throughout. <br><br>The home is currently in its final stages of completion, we will update the photos soon.</p>
		<div style="position:relative; z-index:0;">
			<div id="Mehrfert" class="cycle-slideshow" data-cycle-fx="fade" data-cycle-speed="2500">
			</div>
		</div>
		<p style=" text-align: justify;">Here is a Ski Resort Day Lodge that we have converted to the trinity IPP System. As you can see in the renderings there are virtualy no limits to the size or scope of a Trinity project. We can take any existing plan and redesign it with all the features and benefits one would expect utilizing our construction methods. <br><br>This mountaintop building will feature 12" post and beam timbers and exceptional energy efficient R-40 walls with R-60 roofs. The shell including walls, timbers, roof structure and roof panels can be completed in weeks … not months, typical of this type of construction.</p>
